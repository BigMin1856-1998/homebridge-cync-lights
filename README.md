# Homebridge Cync Lights by GE Plugin

This plugin integrates the Cync Direct Connect light bulbs from GE with Homekit.  These bulbs are very high quality and tolerate
the variations in voltage from power sources much better than many other bulbs on the market.  But GE has abandoned it's 
support for Homekit in it's Cync products.

Thanks to nikshriv (https://github.com/nikshriv/cync_lights) and unixpickle (https://github.com/unixpickle/cbyge) for your research
and insights into the binary protocol.  I've taken heavy influence from the work you all did.
